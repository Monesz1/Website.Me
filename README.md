# Under Construction
Unique Under Construction Templates


Sometimes a redesign might be the only way to get around an old theme, compensating missing features. Leaving website visitors unattended with a black 404 or not found page while your designer is on the project can be devastating. An under construction page and even coming soon pages can come to your rescue while going for a regular maintenance.

A critical turning point in theme redesign is made by most brands when new technologies like responsive, flat design, one page parallax designs emerge. It’s not wise to blank out for a week or two and keep your visitors guessing what’s happening out there. Even with a website under construction theme you get the option to notify your customers, let them subscribe and much more.

A glimpse of your current work under progress will do wonders and may be the first part of marketing to make visitors know more of it.
